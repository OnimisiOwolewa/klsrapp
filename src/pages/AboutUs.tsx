                  More so, among so many tools available in the toolbox of a Christian, faith, is an essential tool that helps a person to connect with God. We found this to be true in the book of <span className='font-extrabold text-white'>Hebrews 11:6</span>
                  
                  </p>
                  <p className='bg-orange-300 p-2 text-[#312e2e] px-4 border-l-4 rounded border-teal-700'>
                  And it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who wants to come to him must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him. <span className='font-extrabold text-white'>Hebrews 11:6</span> 
                  </p>
<br />
                  <p className='p-2'>
                  It is important to know that the word we hear, those we listen to, and the books we read, contribute as well as deposit some form of knowledge into a person. The effect of the words we listen to, and the books we read, usually create a lifestyle that multiplies along the line.

                  <br />
                  <p className='p-2'>Therefore, it is imperative to listen to the right people, the right word that comes in the form of songs, messages, exhortation, Christian based seminar, and sermons in order to build our faith. The Bible stated in Romans 10:17</p>
           
                  <p className='bg-orange-300 p-2 text-[#312e2e] px-4 border-l-4 rounded border-teal-700'>
                  So, then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. <span className='font-extrabold text-white'>Romans 10:17</span> 
                  </p>

                  <p className='p-2'>
                  Moreover, the word of God in the world we live in today is available in various versions which includes the print format, media, social media, electronic, and around our physical environment. All we have to do is to utilize every means or the most preferable means for our spiritual growth.

                  Through the internet or physical representation, a person can be impacted, blessed, and receive healing in the area or areas where they trust God to visitation. Whatever information we receive, with time, we digest, and ultimately turns into an idea a person process on a daily basis. In the long run, that information becomes part of us and eventually they become our lifestyle either consciously or unconsciously.
